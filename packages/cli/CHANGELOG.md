### Minor Changes

- fcf5721: Tool update governance.

  A verified card is content-addressed, so a real change to a tool changes its
  id — but the protocol did not yet _govern_ what a consumer does when an
  approved tool changes underneath it. This adds that layer. It is entirely
  additive: no wire-breaking change, `PROTOCOL_VERSION` stays `0.2`.

  `@glyphp/client` — `GlyphClient` accepts a `PinStore`. It verifies every card
  signature, pins an approved `(id, publicKey)` pair per tool, and refuses in
  `call()` any tool that is new, changed, or revoked. New surface: `inspectCard`,
  `approveCard`, `revokeTool`, `inspectLexicon`, `getManifest`, `MemoryPinStore`,
  and the `GlyphVerificationError` / `GlyphNotApprovedError` / `GlyphRevokedError`
  error types.

  `@glyphp/core` — `diffCards()` classifies how two cards differ (breaking vs
  review changes); `signManifest()` / `verifyManifest()` sign and verify update
  manifests.

  `@glyphp/server` — `registerManifest()` publishes a signed `UpdateManifest`,
  served from the new optional `GET /glyphs/:name/manifest` endpoint.

  `@glyphp/cli` — `glyph diff-card <old> <new>` classifies how two cards differ
  and exits non-zero on a breaking change.

  `@glyphp/types` — new `Pin`, `CardDiff`, `CardFieldChange` and `UpdateManifest`
  types, and the `MANIFEST_VERSION` constant.

  The lifecycle, pinning model and update manifest are specified in
  `spec/update-governance.md`.

### Patch Changes

- 2c64c2d: P1 hardening from the external audit.

  `@glyphp/server` — a glyph handler now receives a `GlyphHandlerContext` with an
  `AbortSignal` that fires when the call exceeds its timeout, so a cooperating
  handler can stop doing real work instead of running on in the background after
  the `504`.

  `@glyphp/adapter-openapi` / `@glyphp/adapter-mcp` — the JSON Schema → Zod
  conversion is now recursive: enums, typed arrays, nested objects and common
  string formats are enforced, instead of only a value's top-level type.

  `@glyphp/cli` — `glyph init` scaffolds `@glyphp/server` at `latest` rather than
  a pinned version that goes stale.
