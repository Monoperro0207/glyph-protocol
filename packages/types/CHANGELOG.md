# @glyphp/types

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 704a89f: Optional execution-attestation slot on `GlyphCard`.

  A card may now carry an optional `attestation: { type, payload, reference? }`
  envelope — opaque external evidence (Sigstore bundle, SLSA provenance, in-toto
  statement, or vendor-specific format) of what code is running behind the
  declared contract. The field enters canonical content, so a change to it
  moves the card `id`; `diffCards()` flags any change as `breaking`.

  `verifyAttestation()` checks the envelope is well-formed and reports whether
  the `type` is one the SDK has a known schema for. Verifying the payload
  against a trust root (Sigstore registry, OIDC, SLSA verifier, etc.) is the
  consumer's responsibility — the SDK cannot certify its own host process.

  Backwards compatible: a card without an attestation hashes identically to a
  0.2-era card.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9236a66: Inert-data hardening — Glyph protocol `0.2`.

  The server now sanitizes every call result before delivery: it strips
  invisible Unicode (the tag block, zero-width characters, bidirectional
  overrides) and C0/C1 control characters, then applies NFKC normalization. The
  `SealedEnvelope` carries an `inspection` report of what was removed, and the
  signed `CallReceipt` commits to it via a new `inspectionHash` field.
  `@glyphp/core` exports a new pure `sanitize()`. `@glyphp/client` exports a
  spotlighting render layer (`renderEnvelope`, `dataPreamble`) that wraps tool
  output in an unforgeable nonce-delimited data block.

  This is a breaking wire change: `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is now `0.2`, and `0.1`
  peers are rejected at handshake with `426 PROTOCOL_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`.

- fcf5721: Tool update governance.

  A verified card is content-addressed, so a real change to a tool changes its
  id — but the protocol did not yet _govern_ what a consumer does when an
  approved tool changes underneath it. This adds that layer. It is entirely
  additive: no wire-breaking change, `PROTOCOL_VERSION` stays `0.2`.

  `@glyphp/client` — `GlyphClient` accepts a `PinStore`. It verifies every card
  signature, pins an approved `(id, publicKey)` pair per tool, and refuses in
  `call()` any tool that is new, changed, or revoked. New surface: `inspectCard`,
  `approveCard`, `revokeTool`, `inspectLexicon`, `getManifest`, `MemoryPinStore`,
  and the `GlyphVerificationError` / `GlyphNotApprovedError` / `GlyphRevokedError`
  error types.

  `@glyphp/core` — `diffCards()` classifies how two cards differ (breaking vs
  review changes); `signManifest()` / `verifyManifest()` sign and verify update
  manifests.

  `@glyphp/server` — `registerManifest()` publishes a signed `UpdateManifest`,
  served from the new optional `GET /glyphs/:name/manifest` endpoint.

  `@glyphp/cli` — `glyph diff-card <old> <new>` classifies how two cards differ
  and exits non-zero on a breaking change.

  `@glyphp/types` — new `Pin`, `CardDiff`, `CardFieldChange` and `UpdateManifest`
  types, and the `MANIFEST_VERSION` constant.

  The lifecycle, pinning model and update manifest are specified in
  `spec/update-governance.md`.
